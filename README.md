# The data that was used for this project is the Seattle airbnb listings data from Kaggle.

# The main information included in the data set is the address, reviews, bedrooms, room type, price, accomodation, satisfaction, and location.

# The main page of my web page gives the main elements of the data set. It gives the number of rows, number of columns and some sample data straight from the data set.

# The plot tab displays a histogram showing the number of Airbnb listings per City in the greater Seattle Area. Cities are listed on the Y axis and the number of listings are on the X axis.

# The Widget that changes the data is check boxes of each city that changes what data is shown on the histogram. The sentence at the bottom shows the number of values (listings) that are being shown when you alter the cities using the checkbox widget.

# The other Widget on the plot page is the color widget that changes the color of the histogram. The options are Red, Purple, Blue and Green. It does not change any of the data.

# The Table tab shows the listings, address, and room type data.

# The Widget changes the data in the table based on the room type. It is done using radio buttons and the number of values that are being shown each time are counted in the sentence below it.

# This project took me 8 hours in total to complete and publish.
